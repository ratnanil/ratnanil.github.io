Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My Name is Nils Ratnaweera and I'm a Research Fellow at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences. I'm a Data Scientist who love his job of working with environmental data using mainly open source tools such as `R`, `python`, `gdal`, `SQL`.


<!-- I understand something better once I try to explain it. This is one of my motivations to start blogging: to learn more on the topics I'm interested in.  -->

<!-- Also, writing helps me complete the thought process of half baked ideas. And last but not least, I want to join the vibrant community of `R` users, open source enthusiasts, spatial people, python lovers, linux advocates and data scientists. -->
