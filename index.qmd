<h3> Hi there ðŸ‘‹  </h3>

My Name is Nils Ratnaweera and I'm a Research Fellow at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences. I'm a Data Scientist who love his job of working with environmental data using mainly open source tools such as `R`, `python`, `gdal`, `ogr2ogr`, `PostgresSQL`, `PostGIS`.

<!-- Also, writing helps me complete the thought process of half baked ideas. And last but not least, I want to join the vibrant community of `R` users, open source enthusiasts, spatial people, python lovers, linux advocates and data scientists. -->
